ViterBrain Tracer

Tracing workflow tips:
- View only the coronal view window in neuroglancer
- Trace proximally to distally.
- Trace to the end of a process before starting a new branch/neuron.
- Place a point at each branch point (so you can come back and trace the other branch using a hook).

Keyboard Controls - all keys must be paired with SHIFT
- S "select" - place point (either start or end)
- L "line" - draw line between either the start and end points, or, if no end point exists, start and the cursor
- N "new" - new path
- C "clear" - clear most recent line segment
- H "hook" - instead of adding the first point for a new trace, you can use this to begin a new branch off an existing trace (it will snap to the closest point of all previously made traces)
