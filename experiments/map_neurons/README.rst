* First, make sure that you have installed the ``brainlit`` package [`Documentation <https://brainlit.netlify.app/readme#installation>`_].

* As a general rule, figures were made in the notebooks in ``brainlit/experiments/map_neurons/`` and, when necessary, heavy computations were done using scripts in ``brainlit/experiments/map_neurons/other``

* The notebooks that made the specific figures in the current version of the manuscript are:

* ``map_neurons.ipynb``: Fig. 1a-b, 2.

* ``motivating-example.ipynb``: Fig. 1e-f.

* ``morphometrics-compare.ipynb``: Fig. 3, 4.

* ``straight-downsample.ipynb``: Fig. 5.

* Other files are more for scratch work, and are unlikely to be useful to new users.
