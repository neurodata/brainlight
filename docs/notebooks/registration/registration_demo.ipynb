Now we look at the maximum_velocity calibration plot, and also start looking at the registration results. We reduce sigma_regularization (from its default value of infinity) until our results look reasonable. In some cases the result is reasonable for the default (very large) sigma_regularization. In other cases we will see unreasonable results like certain lobes or even pixels inflating or various other gross contortions of the deformed image. In the maximum_velocity calibration plot we are looking for a generally smooth and concave-down curve that converges. Sometimes we will not see it converge because it takes more iterations than we are using to do so. Also note the scale of the y-axis in this plot, as it is in units of resolution. It should be roughly on the order of a pixel, maybe more, but if it is much less then very little deformation is happening. \n",
